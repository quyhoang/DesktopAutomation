Greetings,

This file allows you to customize the prompts used by KaiwAI. Please follow the guidelines below:

1. Each line corresponds to a prompt and a shortcut key combination.
2. The first five lines (1-5) are used for the respective shortcut combinations: RControl + 1 to RControl + 5.
3. If a line is left blank, all subsequent lines will be ignored.
4. The prompts will be combined with the selected text and sent to the AI assistant of your choice (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot).

Example:
If you write "Summarize the following: " on line two, you can use the RControl + 2 shortcut to request a summary of your selected text from the AI assistant.

Please note that only the first five non-empty lines will be considered.

Please delete this instruction and write your own prompts into this file.
If you want to edit your prompt list, just open this file and edit manually or press Right Control + F2 while KaiwAI is running.

Thank you for using KaiwAI and good luck with your endeavor!

Best regards,
The KaiwAI Development Team
